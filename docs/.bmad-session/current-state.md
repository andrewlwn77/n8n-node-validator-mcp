# BMAD Session State

## Current Status
- **Active Persona**: qa
- **Current Task**: create-test-strategy
- **Workflow Position**: completed comprehensive test strategy
- **Phase**: testing → documentation

## Pending Handoffs
- **To**: orchestrator
- **Context**: Full BMAD lifecycle complete, ready for final documentation
- **Deliverables**: 
  - `/workspace/docs/test-strategy.md` - Comprehensive testing strategy
  - `/workspace/docs/implementation-summary.md` - Development summary
  - `/workspace/src/` - Complete MCP server implementation
  - `/workspace/tests/` - Test framework and sample tests
  - `/workspace/build/` - Compiled JavaScript output
  - `/workspace/docs/technical/architecture.md` - System architecture
  - `/workspace/docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
  - `/workspace/docs/stories/` - User stories with acceptance criteria
- **Next Action**: finalize-documentation

## Completed Work
- ✅ **Analyst**: Deep research into n8n ecosystem and validation challenges
- ✅ **PM**: Requirements synthesis, PRD creation, and user story development
- ✅ **Architect**: Technical architecture design and technology selection
- ✅ **Developer**: Core MCP server implementation with all three tools
- ✅ **QA**: Comprehensive test strategy and quality assurance planning

## Key Decisions Made
1. **MVP Scope**: Core validation, specification fetching, and node comparison
2. **Target Users**: n8n node developers and AI-assisted developers
3. **Technical Approach**: TypeScript AST parsing, GitHub API integration, MCP compliance
4. **Success Metrics**: 50% debugging time reduction, 99.9% uptime, 100+ users in 3 months

## Critical Requirements for Architecture
- **GitHub API Integration**: Rate limiting, authentication, caching strategy
- **TypeScript Parsing**: AST-based parsing for robust specification analysis
- **MCP Compliance**: Proper tool registration, error handling, transport support
- **Performance**: <3 second validation, caching for specifications
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, structured error reporting

## Next Priority Items
1. System architecture design with component interactions
2. API design and data flow patterns
3. GitHub integration strategy with fallback mechanisms
4. Caching architecture for specifications
5. Error handling and recovery patterns

# Story: Node Implementation Comparison

**Story ID**: N8N-003  
**Epic**: Developer Experience  
**Priority**: High  
**MVP Classification**: Core  
**Points**: 3  
**Sprint**: 1

## User Story
**As a** n8n node developer  
**I want to** compare my node implementation with official specifications or other implementations  
**So that** I can understand differences and align my implementation correctly

## Context
This story provides side-by-side comparison functionality that helps developers understand exactly how their implementation differs from the official specification or other reference implementations. This is particularly valuable for debugging and understanding compliance gaps.

This story builds on the specification fetching capability and provides additional insight beyond basic validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** two valid node JSON strings **When** comparison is requested **Then** all property differences are identified and categorized
- [ ] **Given** identical node implementations **When** comparison runs **Then** system reports no differences with confirmation message
- [ ] **Given** nodes with different properties **When** comparison runs **Then** differences are categorized as missing, extra, or different values
- [ ] **Given** nodes with nested property differences **When** comparison runs **Then** exact path locations are provided for each difference
- [ ] **Given** complex node structures **When** comparison runs **Then** structured diff output is provided with clear formatting
- [ ] Error handling: Invalid JSON inputs return structured parsing errors
- [ ] Edge cases: Handle null/undefined values and empty objects gracefully
- [ ] Performance: Comparison completes within 1 second for typical nodes

## Technical Guidance

### Implementation Approach
- Implement deep object comparison with recursive traversal
- Create difference categorization system (missing, extra, different)
- Use path tracking to provide exact location of differences
- Format output as structured markdown for readability

### Architecture Alignment
- Build as utility function that can be used by validation and standalone
- Use functional programming approach for immutable comparisons
- Design for extensibility with custom comparison rules
- Ensure compatibility with existing validation output format

### API Changes
- Implement `compare_nodes` MCP tool with schema validation
- Accept `localNode` (string) and `specNode` (string) parameters
- Return structured comparison result with categorized differences
- Include similarity score and summary statistics

### Data Changes
- No persistent storage required
- Process data in-memory for fast comparison
- Consider caching comparison results for repeated requests
- Structure output for consistent formatting

### Integration Points
- **JSON Parsing**: Parse both node implementations
- **Deep Comparison**: Recursive object comparison logic
- **Path Tracking**: Maintain property path context
- **Markdown Formatting**: Structure output for readability

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize for large node objects with many properties
- Use efficient comparison algorithms for nested structures
- Implement early termination for identical objects
- Consider parallel comparison for independent property trees

### Security Considerations
- Validate JSON inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Limit comparison size to prevent memory exhaustion
- Sanitize property names and values in output
- Implement timeout for very large comparisons

## Design & UX

### User Flow
1. Developer provides two node JSON implementations
2. System parses both inputs and validates structure
3. Deep comparison identifies all differences
4. Structured report shows categorized differences
5. Developer uses insights to align implementations

### UI Requirements
- Clear section headers for different types of differences
- Side-by-side value comparison for modified properties
- Visual indicators for missing, extra, and different values
- Summary statistics at the top
- Collapsible sections for large differences

### Mockups/Wireframes

# Node Comparison Result

## Status: ❌ DIFFERENCES FOUND

Found 4 differences between local and spec nodes

## Differences Found (4)

### displayName
- **Type**: different_value
- **Local Value**: "My GitHub Node"
- **Spec Value**: "GitHub"

### version
- **Type**: missing_in_local
- **Local Value**: undefined
- **Spec Value**: 1

### customProperty
- **Type**: extra_in_local
- **Local Value**: "custom value"
- **Spec Value**: undefined

### properties[0].name
- **Type**: different_value
- **Local Value**: "repo"
- **Spec Value**: "repository"

## Summary
Found 4 differences that should be reviewed:
- 1 different value
- 1 missing property
- 1 extra property
- 1 nested difference
```

### Accessibility
- Use semantic markdown structure for differences
- Provide clear headings for screen reader navigation
- Ensure color-blind friendly indicators
- Use consistent formatting for property paths

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Two node implementations with minor differences
2. System identifies all differences accurately
3. Categorizes differences correctly by type
4. Provides clear property paths for each difference

### Error Cases
1. **Invalid JSON Input**
   - Trigger: Malformed JSON in either parameter
   - Expected: Structured parsing error with specific input

2. **Very Large Node Objects**
   - Trigger: Nodes with 1000+ properties
   - Expected: Efficient comparison with performance warning

3. **Circular References**
   - Trigger: Node objects with circular references
   - Expected: Graceful handling with cycle detection

4. **Empty or Null Inputs**
   - Trigger: Empty strings or null values
   - Expected: Clear error message with usage guidance

### Edge Cases
- Identical objects (no differences)
- Objects with only missing properties
- Objects with only extra properties
- Deep nested differences (5+ levels)
- Properties with special characters or symbols

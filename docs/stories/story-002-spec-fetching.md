# Story: Official Specification Fetching

**Story ID**: N8N-002  
**Epic**: Specification Management  
**Priority**: Critical  
**MVP Classification**: Core  
**Points**: 5  
**Sprint**: 1

## User Story
**As a** n8n node developer  
**I want to** fetch official node specifications from the n8n repository  
**So that** I can understand the expected structure and validate against current standards

## Context
This story implements the specification fetching capability that powers the validation functionality. It provides developers with direct access to official n8n node specifications without manual GitHub navigation. The fetching system must handle various node types, versions, and provide robust error handling for API limitations.

This story is foundational and required for Story N8N-001 (Core Validation) to function.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** a valid node type **When** specification is requested **Then** the system fetches the official TypeScript definition from n8n repository
- [ ] **Given** a node type with multiple versions **When** specific version is requested **Then** the correct version specification is returned
- [ ] **Given** a common node type **When** specification is fetched **Then** both TypeScript and JSON metadata files are retrieved
- [ ] **Given** an invalid node type **When** specification is requested **Then** a clear error message indicates the node was not found
- [ ] **Given** repeated requests for the same specification **When** fetching occurs **Then** cached results are returned to avoid rate limiting
- [ ] Error handling: GitHub API failures return structured error with retry guidance
- [ ] Edge cases: Handle node types with special characters or unusual naming
- [ ] Performance: Specification fetching completes within 2 seconds with caching

## Technical Guidance

### Implementation Approach
- Implement GitHub API client with authentication support
- Use GitHub Code Search API to locate node definition files
- Parse both TypeScript (.node.ts) and JSON (.node.json) files
- Implement intelligent caching with TTL for API responses
- Create robust error handling for various API failure scenarios

### Architecture Alignment
- Build as separate service component that validation depends on
- Use repository pattern for GitHub API interactions
- Implement cache abstraction that can be extended to Redis later
- Design for testability with mock GitHub API responses

### API Changes
- Implement `fetch_node_spec` MCP tool with schema validation
- Accept `nodeType` (string) and optional `nodeVersion` (string) parameters
- Return structured specification data with metadata
- Include file paths, content, and version information

### Data Changes
- Implement in-memory specification cache with Map structure
- Cache key: `${nodeType}:${version || 'latest'}`
- Cache TTL: 1 hour for production, 5 minutes for development
- Consider LRU eviction for memory management

### Integration Points
- **GitHub API**: Primary data source for specifications
- **GitHub Code Search**: Find node definition files
- **GitHub Contents API**: Retrieve file content
- **Base64 Decoding**: Parse GitHub API file content
- **TypeScript Parser**: Extract structured data from definitions

### Performance Considerations
- Implement parallel requests for TypeScript and JSON files
- Use Promise.all for concurrent GitHub API calls
- Implement request deduplication for simultaneous requests
- Add connection pooling for GitHub API requests

### Security Considerations
- Support GitHub token authentication for higher rate limits
- Validate all GitHub API responses before processing
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Design & UX

### User Flow
1. Developer requests specification for node type
2. System searches n8n repository for matching files
3. Both TypeScript and JSON files are retrieved
4. Parsed specification data is returned
5. Results are cached for subsequent requests

### UI Requirements
- Markdown-formatted specification display
- Clear metadata section with file information
- Structured property listings
- Raw content sections for reference
- Version and path information prominently displayed

### Mockups/Wireframes
```
# n8n Node Specification: GitHub

## Basic Information
- **Display Name**: GitHub
- **Name**: github
- **Version**: 1
- **Description**: GitHub API operations
- **Group**: Development
- **Icon**: file:github.svg

## Properties (3)
- **Repository** (`repository`): string
- **Operation** (`operation`): options
- **Authentication** (`authentication`): credentials

## File Information
- **Path**: packages/nodes-base/nodes/GitHub/GitHub.node.ts
- **Version**: latest

## Raw TypeScript Content
```typescript
export class GitHub implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'GitHub',
    name: 'github',
    ...
  };
}
```
```

### Accessibility
- Use semantic headings for specification sections
- Provide keyboard navigation through specification data
- Ensure code blocks are readable by screen readers
- Use high contrast for syntax highlighting

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Request specification for "GitHub" node type
2. System finds GitHub.node.ts in n8n repository
3. Both TypeScript and JSON files are retrieved
4. Parsed specification data is returned with metadata

### Error Cases
1. **Node Type Not Found**
   - Trigger: Request specification for "NonExistentNode"
   - Expected: Clear error message with suggestions

2. **GitHub API Rate Limit**
   - Trigger: Exceed API rate limit
   - Expected: Cached response or retry guidance

3. **Network Failure**
   - Trigger: GitHub API unavailable
   - Expected: Graceful error with fallback options

4. **Invalid File Format**
   - Trigger: Malformed TypeScript file
   - Expected: Parsing error with file details

### Edge Cases
- Node types with special characters (e.g., "HTTP Request")
- Nodes with only TypeScript files (no JSON metadata)
- Very large node definition files
- Multiple matching files for same node type
- Repository structure changes

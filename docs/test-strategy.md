# Test Strategy: n8n Validator MCP

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Quality Built-In**: Testing is integrated throughout development, not added at the end
- **Fast Feedback**: Tests provide rapid feedback during development  
- **Reliable Results**: Tests are deterministic and trusted by the team
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications
- **User-Centric**: Tests validate actual user value and workflows

### Quality Goals
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for validation requests
- **Performance**: <3 seconds for validation, <2 seconds for spec fetching, <1 second for comparison
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, and secure GitHub API handling
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and actionable validation feedback

## Test Level Strategy

### Unit Testing
**Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and small modules in isolation
- **Tools**: Jest with TypeScript support
- **Location**: `tests/unit/` directory mirroring source structure
- **Coverage Target**: 80% line coverage for business logic, 90% for validation engine

**Approach**:
- Test all public methods and significant logic paths
- Mock external dependencies (GitHub API, file system, time)
- Focus on validation logic, parsing algorithms, and edge cases
- Test error conditions and boundary values

**Mocking Strategy**:
- **Mock Library**: Jest mocks and manual mocks
- **External Dependencies**: GitHub API calls, file system operations
- **Time/Dates**: Use deterministic time for consistent test results
- **Cache Operations**: Mock cache for predictable test behavior

### Integration Testing
**Scope**: Component interactions within MCP server boundaries
- **Tools**: Jest with real GitHub API integration (rate-limited)
- **Location**: `tests/integration/` directory
- **Environment**: Containerized test environment with mock GitHub responses

**Test Categories**:
- **MCP Tool Integration**: Full tool workflow with service composition
- **GitHub API Integration**: Real API calls with caching and error handling
- **Service Layer Integration**: Multi-service workflows and data flow
- **Error Propagation**: End-to-end error handling and user messaging

### End-to-End Testing
**Scope**: Complete MCP tool workflows from Claude Code integration
- **Tools**: MCP SDK test harness with tool invocation
- **Environment**: Local MCP server with stdio transport

**Critical User Journeys**:
1. **Node Validation Flow**: Developer validates node → fetches spec → validates → receives report
2. **Specification Fetching Flow**: Developer requests spec → GitHub API → parsed response
3. **Node Comparison Flow**: Developer compares nodes → deep comparison → difference report
4. **Error Recovery Flow**: Invalid inputs → graceful error handling → user-friendly messages

**Error Scenarios**:
- GitHub API rate limiting and failures
- Invalid JSON parsing
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid node types and malformed specifications

## Specialized Testing

### Performance Testing
**Tools**: Jest with performance measurement utilities

**Test Types**:
- **Load Testing**: Concurrent validation requests
- **Stress Testing**: Maximum cache capacity and memory usage
- **Response Time Testing**: Individual tool performance validation
- **Cache Efficiency Testing**: Cache hit rates and performance impact

**Performance Targets**:
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Validation Response Time | <3 seconds | 95th percentile |
| Spec Fetching Time | <2 seconds | 95th percentile |
| Node Comparison Time | <1 second | 95th percentile |
| Cache Hit Rate | >90% | For repeated requests |

### Security Testing
**Approach**: OWASP testing methodology adapted for CLI tools

**Test Areas**:
- **Input Validation**: JSON injection, oversized inputs, malformed data
- **API Security**: GitHub token handling, rate limiting compliance
- **Output Sanitization**: No sensitive data in error messages
- **Memory Safety**: No memory leaks in long-running processes
- **Dependency Security**: Regular security scanning of dependencies

### Reliability Testing
**MCP Protocol Compliance**: Strict adherence to JSON-RPC 2.0 specification

**Testing Approach**:
- **Tool Registration**: Proper tool schema and discovery
- **Error Handling**: Correct MCP error codes and messages
- **Transport Testing**: Stdio transport reliability
- **State Management**: Stateless operation validation

## Testing Environments
